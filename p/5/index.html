        <h1 class="">Relearning PHP</h1>
        <h2 class="">February 28, 2012</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Very little of my programming life has been outside of the JVM world. Java was the primary language at my college, and is the primary language at my workplace. Recently, I've gotten into Groovy, which is a dynamic language for the JVM. I dabbled a small amount in C++ and PHP, but didn't stick with them.</p><p>I recently began collaborating with a friend on a website, so I've been trying to relearn PHP which is our common denominator. I read through most of the manual on php.net, but needed something that gave a little more</p>

        <h1 class="">Civility</h1>
        <h2 class="">January 12, 2012</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Jon Stewart had a great interview with Senator Jim DeMint (R-IL) on last night's The Daily Show. You can watch the full episode <a href="http://bit.ly/zkFoev">here</a>. You should really watch the extended interview (about 25 minutes) that's linked on the page.</p><p>My big takeaway from that interview was that if politicians weren't as worried about performing for their electorate, they could actually be reasonable people. From Stewart's explanation of the book, DeMint painted a very black and white picture of this country. However, when talking in a civil interview he made reasonable points about regulation, spending, etc. not being unnecessary, but needing to be more effective.</p>

        <h1 class="">Unit Testing Legislation</h1>
        <h2 class="">January 12, 2012</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Just think how cool it would be if you could run unit tests on legislation...</p><p>I was just reading through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">Wikipedia page</a> on <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.3261:">SOPA</a> (the Stop Online Piracy Act), with people going back and forth about whether the bill's language does or does not permit certain activity. I'm misusing the term unit testing, but the idea of running automated tests against legislation to verify that it fulfills it's intended purpose is very appealing. It's inherently difficult (more likely impossible) given the way that law works (not that I understand it), but just go with me for a minute. Imagine if you could write (and run) something like this (yay for <a href="http://spockframework.org/">Spock</a> against SOPA:</p>

        <h1 class="">Abolish Daylight Savings Time</h1>
        <h2 class="">November 4, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I don't have anything particularly interesting to say about this, but I just saw this <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/11/04/why-daylight-saving-time-should-be-eliminated/">blog post</a> in my Google Reader. Not my favorite article on the stupidity of Daylight Savings Time, but it'll do.</p><p>I also read this <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2009/03/its_time_for_double_daylight_s.html">article</a> from the Washington Post earlier this week, which called for us to move to double Daylight Savings Time. And this is potentially year round... Up here, that means in the depths of winter it would be about 10:00 in the morning before the sun rose. But, yes, it's very important that your get your extra hour of daylight at night time. Because American's spend so much time outside as it is... Maybe your real issue is that you can't figure out how to wake up an hour earlier.</p>

        <h1 class="">Letter to My Representiatives</h1>
        <h2 class="">July 23, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Below is the letter I just sent to my representatives. Please send one to yours, regardless of your opinion.</p><blockquote><p>Senators Franken and Klobuchar and Representative McCollum,</p><p>This is the first time I've personally written my representatives. This debt ceiling issue is absurd. I've heard many politicians say what "the American people" want. Yet many still act like what we really want is them to get re-elected. Regardless of your qualifications, you are elected to represent us and make a difference. NOT to act solely to be re-elected so you can make a difference tomorrow.</p><p>I urge you to be fair and levelheaded on the issue of the deficit and the debt ceiling. Please work with your colleagues to raise (or abolish) the debt ceiling and to work towards a balanced budget that will reduce our deficit.</p><p>It is time to put your party lines aside and do something that makes sense. Make significant cuts and increase revenue (raise some taxes).</p><p>Please act before the debt limit costs us more than a compromise would.</p></blockquote>
