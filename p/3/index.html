    <p>I heard about <a href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That</a> on <a href="http://twit.tv/tnt">Tech News Today</a> a couple weeks ago and just started playing around with it today. It's basically a way for you to automate all kinds of tasks based on different web services (mostly social networks) that you use. Some examples:</p><ul><li>Post all new blog posts (RSS entries) to Twitter.</li><li>Add all Last.fm scrobbles in new rows in a Google Drive spreadsheet.</li><li>Save any Youtube videos I mark as "watch later" to Pocket.</li><li>Email me if it's going to rain tomorrow.</li></ul>

    <p>After completing 7 Languages in 7 Weeks, I decided to start working on a project to get my feet wet in Scala. For the past couple weeks I've been reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step-step/dp/0981531601">Programming in Scala</a>, which is seemingly the definitive Scala book and is written by the language author.</p><p>I've really enjoyed a lot of Scala features so far:</p>

    <p>I'm all done with the <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">7 Languages in 7 Weeks</a> book. Overall, I was very happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking to broaden their programming horizons.</p><p>This book had a very different style from other programming books I've read. Rather than explain everything I needed to understand the language (and the exercises), the author cut narrow but deep slices through the language to pick out some interesting concepts. With a book trying to show me 7 programming languages, there's nowhere near enough room to explain everything. The big benefit of that is I got to do some non-trivial examples very quickly. But since I didn't have a firm foundation in each language, I very easily tripped myself up.</p>

    <p>The final language of 7 Languages in 7 Weeks was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>, the only pure functional language in the book. This is the only chapter where I completely gave up on most of the exercises. More on that later...</p><p>Haskell as a functional language does a lot of the things I've seen in half the languages in the book. It has a list comprehension syntax almost identical to Erlang's, the common list manipulation functions like map, filter, and foldl, as well as pattern matching. Here's one example of a Haskell function:</p>

    <p>Chapter 5 of 7 Languages in 7 Weeks is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">Erlang</a>. Erlang is a functional language with a strong focus on concurrency and reliability. Its syntax is based on Prolog (i.e. it's weird). The author described it as a language that "makes easy things hard, and hard things easy".</p><p>As a functional language it has a lot of functions geared towards collection operations (e.g. map, foreach, foldl). Nothing terrible weird about those. It does have this cool feature they call list comprehensions, that are a way for you to combine most of those operations into one line:</p>
