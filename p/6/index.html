        <h1 class="">Sharing on Google+</h1>
        <h2 class="">July 16, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>For those not aware, <a href="http://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> allows you to share your posts publicly or to any number of circles, which are user-defined collections of people that they follow the posts of. This was meant to allow for privacy where, for example, if I have some family photos I want to share, I could share them with my family circle rather than publicly (as in Twitter)  or with all of my connections (as in Facebook).</p><p>Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/06/30/social-is-for-sharing-not-hiding/">mentions</a> that he uses circles to limit sharing out of relevance not privacy. That may mean that there are some posts he is fine sharing publicly, but doesn't because it would likely be noise to most of his followers. An extension of the circles concept would be some notion of sharing within a category (or topic or tag).</p>

        <h1 class="">Netflix and Recommender Systems</h1>
        <h2 class="">June 11, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>This was written as a speech for a training class at work, so the tone is a little odd for a blog post, but oh well.</p><blockquote><p>Gary, Sue, and 10 other people like this comment. Customers who shopped for this chair also shopped for that CD. Our best guess for you is 3.7 stars. Many sites now recommend things to you based on the way you use their site. But why do they need to do this?  You can find anything on the Internet. But, because everything is at your fingertips, there's an information overload. There's no way I can look through every movie Netflix has and find the one I should watch next. In order to help us navigate all of these choices, and ultimately become loyal paying customers, websites need to provide value by showing us things we will like.</p><p>Most sites today that have user ratings information will still merely show you a basic average of everyone's opinion. Based on the number of ratings, this will either tell you what the entire world thinks of something (if it's popular), or what some cult following thinks of it. Neither of which is necessarily applicable to you. What you would rather know is what people who have similar tastes think of it.</p><p>For my senior research project, I looked at recommender systems; specifically in the context of the Netflix Prize. The goal of this contest was to improve on Netflix's recommendation algorithm by 10%, for which they would award $1 million. They released a massive dataset of 100 million ratings from around a half-million users across a total of 18,000 movies.</p><p>Through my research I found that there are many different approaches to recommender systems. I'll just cover one that's a little easier to visualize, called matrix factorization. I'll skip the gory math details, but essentially what it tries to do is detect common features among movies. You can think of a feature as action, comedy, or romance, but it ends up being more abstract than that since the algorithm doesn't understand those concepts, it just sees a common thread in the data. For a particular feature, it will try to estimate how much a movie exhibits each of those features and how much a user likes a particular feature. The algorithm will take all of these features together to make its prediction.</p><p>What you ultimately want get out of these recommender systems, is the ability to take advantage of all of the variety these services provide, but not have to do the dirty work yourself. You can leverage recommendations based on your own preferences, to ideally find movies that you might not have find on a best-seller list, but may just be your favorite movie that you never knew existed.</p></blockquote>

        <h1 class="">The Budget and The Gang of Six</h1>
        <h2 class="">April 17, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I was reading the Star Tribune today, which had a few budget related articles. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/us/politics/17fiscal.html?_r=1">One</a> was related to the Gang of Six who is trying to get a bipartisan budget deal going. (Note: this is actually an NY Times article)  They also mentioned the NY Times budget calculator from November. I played around with it for a while (here's my <a href="http://nyti.ms/eBHTOP">plan</a>), which surprising to me required less tax increases than I thought I would have picked. One thing is clear to me after using the tool; something is wrong with Medicare. Admittedly, I have no knowledge of what the effect of the cuts or taxes I chose would beyond the numbers the Times gives. Obviously, it's also a very simplistic view of a complex issue. But it's good to give the public a taste of what those choices are like.</p><p>I decided to do a little research on this since I don't spend much time reading (or watching) the news. I downloaded Paul Ryan's (House Budget Committee) <a href="http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf">Path to Prosperity</a> plan. I got through the summary before giving up. It reads like a campaign message, and spends most of the time attacking Obama. While I'm generally pro-Obama, I don't believe he is above criticism. However, I feel like the people in charge of our budget should spend a little more time doing their job rather than trying to keep their job (naive, huh?).</p>

        <h1 class="">Android ... Open?</h1>
        <h2 class="">March 31, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>BusinessWeek posted an <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_15/b4223041200216.htm">article</a> last night about Android's openness. Rumor is that Google is trying to restrict manufacturers ability to tweak the platform. Considering there isn't anything from Google at this point it's hard to say whether this is any more than grumbling by execs at the device manufacturers. I understand their desire to differentiate their phones from their competitors by customizing the UI. However, as a an Android consumer myself, I don't want their customized OS when it comes at the cost of being stuck on the same version of Android for the life of my phone. I'm a little confused as to how some of these restrictions would work. For example, there is supposedly a "non-fragmentation clause" that Google wants everyone to agree to. Admittedly, I am not an open source, nor Android, expert, but considering this is Apache licensed software we are talking about, how can they restrict people's use of it? Are they going to be delaying the source drops? I've never liked this idea that Android gives a manufacturer early access to the source code. It seems like it should be developed in the open like many of the big open source projects. This seems like an unfortunate direction for Google to go down.</p>

        <h1 class="">AT&amp;T and T-Mobile ... Net Neutrality?</h1>
        <h2 class="">March 20, 2011</h2>
    </header>
    <p>So the big story today is the AT&amp;T acquisition of T-Mobile. Here's the <a href="http://www.mobilizeeverything.com/home.php">announcement</a>.</p><p>There's been a lot of talk about whether it will be approved by the FCC, and what kind of concessions the FCC might make AT&amp;T accept. For example, this <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/03/20/att-tmobile-regulators/">GigaOm article</a> and today's episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT</a> specifically talk about net neutrality concessions. While I like the idea of getting net neutrality, or anything else, out of AT&amp;T, I really dislike that this seems to be the only way the FCC can put this in place. While I agree with the people who say they don't want the government putting their hands on the Internet, that is their job. The FCC's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission#Mission_and_strategy">mission</a> is basically to protect the neutrality of our communications infrastructure.</p>
