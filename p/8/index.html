        <h1 class="">NSVD1 Grr...</h1>
        <h2 class="">April 3, 2009</h2>
    </header>
    <p>So I tried to work on Gravity's training algorithm for Patarek's NSVD1 recommender. And utterly failed. I'm either reading it wrong, typing wrong, or not understanding the notation, but it's supposed to give me a RMSE of 0.9344, but mine has gone between. 1.013 and 2 something. Yeah...</p><p>So I'm going to be redoing that one. Hopefully after getting that working, I can do the Hybrid and then finally get on to a few of my own modifications. I only need to figure out what they should be.</p>

        <h1 class="">Progress Without Perfection</h1>
        <h2 class="">March 24, 2009</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Initially, I thought that given the nice detail in the Gravity team's papers, I would be able to implement these and get very close scores. It has turned out not to be the case. As the models get bigger and more complex my results have moved farther away from theirs: not terribly far, but far enough. This could be a factor of details they didn't include in the papers, details I missed in the papers, or my misinterpretations (or programming errors) in implementing them.</p><p>This was irritating me last week, because I didn't really want to move on to the next level of the algorithm until I had gotten the previous one working. But now I've given up on that. Even though I am not as close to their results as I would like, I am making progress and now with my implementation of their 250 feature, retrained model BRISMF#250UM I have a quiz score of 0.8967.</p>

        <h1 class="">Don&#39;t Rush Your Math</h1>
        <h2 class="">March 17, 2009</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I've been trying to implement Gravity's BRISMF#250 model but have been getting much higher RMSEs. I had no idea what was wrong so I decided to move on and start implementing the code to retrain features after the initial training. To test I had to rerun my BRISMF#1 model which resulted in an RMSE 0.01 higher, which made no sense. I looked through my code for changes I've made since I initially ran that and came across an error.</p><p>Most algorithms will require different ranges of random values to fill the feature arrays. But, the way Java's random double generator is set up, it will only return a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Since that's not going to be helpful, I made a quick equation to modify the range. Unfortunately I rushed through what should have been a simple equation and came up with the following.</p>

        <h1 class="">My First Attempts</h1>
        <h2 class="">March 13, 2009</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I'll preface this by saying I have no hopes, expectations, or anything else of actually competing in this prize. I came into this hoping to learn about recommender systems.</p><p>So I started by finding some research papers on recommender systems and collaborative filtering. I read that and assumed I could start implementing a nearest neighbor algorithm. So I pulled out my trusty old Java and wrote a quick app to import the training set into a MySQL database. Once the import actually started to work, it took 10 hours to import. Once that happened some reality set in as to how massive this was compared to anything I'd worked on before. Little did I know, I still hadn't learned.</p>

        <h1 class="">Matrix Factorization</h1>
        <h2 class="">March 13, 2009</h2>
    </header>
    <p>The idea behind matrix factorization (which is similar if not the same as what the Netflix community is calling SVD, singular vector decomposition or something) is that you can estimate an <code>I x J</code> matrix <code>R</code> (the ratings matrix) by multiplying two smaller matrices: an <code>I x K</code> and a <code>K x J</code>. Each of those <code>K</code> rows/columns is known as a feature and the matrix factorization (MF) algorithm will estimate the scores for each user and movie.</p><p>What this allows you to do is essentially generate scores for how much action, comedy, romance, etc. is in a movie. And also how much a certain user likes those aspects.</p>
