Haven't posted in a while, but last call for the Netflix Prize has been out for nearly a month. There may finally be a winner. I'm wondering if the site will be shut down after that or if it will keep going. They would of course have to come up with some new reasoning for the project, since they've already got a 10% improvement over their algorithm.
