The final language of 7 Languages in 7 Weeks was [Haskell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)), the only pure functional language in the book. This is the only chapter where I completely gave up on most of the exercises. More on that later...

Haskell as a functional language does a lot of the things I've seen in half the languages in the book. It has a list comprehension syntax almost identical to Erlang's, the common list manipulation functions like map, filter, and foldl, as well as pattern matching. Here's one example of a Haskell function:

```haskell
allEven [] = []
allEven (h:t) = if even h then h:allEven t else allEven t
```

One of the biggest differences with Haskell compared to the other functional languages in the book is its strong, static type system. Like Scala, a lot of the types are inferred from the context. The author really hyped it up, so I thought it would be pretty intuitive. Once I dug into the second set of exercises, however, I was baffled. I tried making a function for removing an item from a list:

```haskell
listRemove :: [Integer] -> Integer -> [Integer]
listRemove list x = foldl (\elem result -> if x == elem then result else elem:result) [] list
```

Seemed like it should work to me. However when I compiled it, I got this:

```
Couldn't match expected type `[Integer]' with actual type `Integer'
In the first argument of `listRemove', namely `min'
In the first argument of `sort', namely `(listRemove min list)'
In the second argument of `(:)', namely
  `(sort (listRemove min list))'
Failed, modules loaded: none.
```
While, at first glance, that appears to be a well described error, I can't for the life of me figure out why elem is being treated as an `[Integer]` rather than an `Integer`... And that right there is where I stopped doing the exercises.

Onle last feature of Haskell that I'll mention is that you can only declare functions with one argument. You can essentially create multi-argument functions, but they're actually "curried" to form the end result.

```haskell
-- function with two parameters (kind of)
product x y = x * y

-- calling product 3 4 is equivalent to
(product 3) 4
```

This happens because the function "product" doesn't take two arguments. The type declaration for this would be:

```haskell
double :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
```

Which means product is a function that takes one `Integer` but returns a function that takes one more `Integer` which then returns an `Integer`. Pretty interesting concept.

There was another chapter on declaring types and monads which went almost completely over my head. It didn't help that I was already frustrated with Haskell and didn't really care how it worked anymore.

Haskell seems like it would teach me a lot about functional programming, but I don't have any intention of looking at it anytime soon. I'm sure it would be a lot easier to understand with a book tailored towards teaching the language rather than just getting a taste of what it has to offer.

I've got one more post coming to wrap up the 7 Languages book.
