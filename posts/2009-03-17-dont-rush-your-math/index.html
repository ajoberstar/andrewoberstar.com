    <p>I've been trying to implement Gravity's BRISMF#250 model but have been getting much higher RMSEs. I had no idea what was wrong so I decided to move on and start implementing the code to retrain features after the initial training. To test I had to rerun my BRISMF#1 model which resulted in an RMSE 0.01 higher, which made no sense. I looked through my code for changes I've made since I initially ran that and came across an error.</p><p>Most algorithms will require different ranges of random values to fill the feature arrays. But, the way Java's random double generator is set up, it will only return a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Since that's not going to be helpful, I made a quick equation to modify the range. Unfortunately I rushed through what should have been a simple equation and came up with the following.</p><pre><code class="java">value = randomDouble * (max - min) - min;
</code></pre><p>The problem with this is if you wanted a range between -0.01 and 0.01, you end up with one between 0.02 and 0.03. It should have been:</p><pre><code class="java">value = randomDouble * (max - min) + min;
</code></pre><p>Now that I've fixed this I can try BRISMF#250 again. Lesson learned: don't rush your math (even really simple math).</p>
