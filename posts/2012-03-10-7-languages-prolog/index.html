        <h1>7 Languages: Prolog</h1>

    <p>Next up in 7 Languages in 7 Weeks was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>. This is a logic programming language. Your "code" defines facts and rules, and then executes queries on them. It's all declarative, you don't ever see the algorithm that Prolog uses. It's a very different way of thinking, since you are just describing the problem, and asking Prolog to solve it for you.</p><p>One of the challenges was to reverse a list in Prolog.</p><pre><code class="prolog">list_reverse([], []).
list_reverse([X], [X]).
list_reverse([Head|Tail], Reversed) :-
    list_reverse(Tail, ReversedTail),
    append(ReversedTail, [Head], Reversed).
</code></pre><p>Here's some explanation of that:</p><ol><li>The reverse of an empty list is an empty list.</li><li>The reverse of a one item list of the same one item list.</li><li>The reverse of a two or more element list is the reversal of elements 2 through the end followed by the first element.</li></ol><p>I had a hard time wrapping my head around this approach. The third set of exercises was solving Sudoku and the 8 Queens problem. The solution the author showed for a 4x4 solution was interesting, but it seemed way too tedious.</p><pre><code class="prolog">valid([]).
valid([Head|Tail]) :-
   fd_all_different(Head),
   valid(Tail).

sudoku(Puzzle, Solution) :-
    Solution = Puzzle,
    Puzzle = [S11, S12, S13, S14,
              S21, S22, S23, S24,
              S31, S32, S33, S34,
              S41, S42, S43, S44],
    fd_domain(Solution, 1, 4),
    Row1 = [S11, S12, S13, S14],
    Row2 = [S21, S22, S23, S24],
    Row3 = [S31, S32, S33, S34],
    Row4 = [S41, S42, S43, S44],
    Column1 = [S11, S21, S31, S41],
    Column2 = [S12, S22, S32, S42],
    Column3 = [S13, S23, S33, S43],
    Column4 = [S14, S24, S34, S44],
    Square1 = [S11, S12, S21, S22],
    Square2 = [S13, S14, S23, S24],
    Square3 = [S31, S32, S41, S42],
    Square4 = [S33, S34, S43, S44],
    valid([Row1, Row2, Row3, Row4,
        Column1, Column2, Column3, Column4,
        Square1, Square2, Square3, Square4]).
</code></pre><p>The exercise was to expand that solution for 6x6 and 9x9. That would have either meant a lot of typing and no thinking or an extreme amount of thinking trying to generalize a solution. I just didn't grasp the though process required for Prolog enough to try that.</p><p>Prolog has some fascinating use cases. At the beginning of the chapter, the author interviewed someone who had writing a masters thesis on predicting the behavior of a trained dolphin, given the rules the dolphin was taught. Apparently, Prolog also has a lot of use in natural language processing, with the IBM Watson computer even being partially written in it.</p><p>The end result is that Prolog doesn't click for me. I would need a lot more time with it than I want to spend. Especially considering I don't see any direct use cases for Prolog in the stuff I like to play around with.</p><p>Next up is Scala.</p>
